I couldn't get the program to run on my emulator. But taking a look at your code I noticed there are very few notes so it's difficult to know whats going on in your code. It would be helpful to know your thought processes because I coded mine very differently. After the first function, you added semi colon and parenthesis that shouldn't be there until later. If they are there they end the action so each function doesn't know when to run. By changing these you should get better results. Everything else looks written correctly as shown in the book.
