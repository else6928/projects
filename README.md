First of all, the program would not run on my emulator. I was given the "proccess exit value was 1" error. 
I noticed that you did not establish a tab group. 
In line 81 "teaVerdict.background = _args;" I changed to teaVerdict.backgroundColor = _args:"
In line 87 "close.addEvenntListener('click', function(e)" event has two 'n's 
More notes would definitely help to decipher the code. I had trouble because things seem pretty mixed up to me. I basically re did the code from the book to get it working.
